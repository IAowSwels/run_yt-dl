# run_yt-dl
The python script inside enables you to use the standalone youtube-dl file on linux with a custom config.

It's important to enter only full options in config. Means the "output" option is not allowed to shorten to "o".
To run the script place the latest youtube-dl release from [here]([url](https://github.com/ytdl-patched/youtube-dl/releases)) in the same directory.
